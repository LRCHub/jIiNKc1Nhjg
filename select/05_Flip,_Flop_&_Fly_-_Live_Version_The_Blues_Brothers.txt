Well now when I get the blues, gonna get me a rockin chair
Well now when i get the blues, gonna get me a rockin chair
And if the blues over take me, gonna rock right away from here
Now when I get lonesome I'll get on the telephone
Now when I get lonesome I'll get on the telephone
Well I call my baby, tell her I'm on my way back home
Well flip, flop & fly
I don't care if I die
Flip, flop & fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me, don't ever say goodbye
Give me one last kiss, hold it a long, long time
Give me one last kiss, hold it a long long time
Well hold that kiss til I feel it in my head like wine
Well here come my baby flashin a new gold tooth
Well here come my baby flashin a new gold tooth
Well she's so small, she could model in a pay phone booth
A-well flip, flop & fly
I don't care if I die
Flip, flop & fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me, don't ever say goodbye
Like a Mississippi bullfrog sittin on a hot stump
Like a Mississippi bullfrog sittin on a hot stump
There's so many women I don't know which way to jump
Well flip, flop & fly
I don't care if I die
Flip, flop & fly
I don't care if I die
Don't ever leave me, don't ever say goodbye
End
